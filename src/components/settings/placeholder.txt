// Wrapper to fetch data server side then pass to client forms would be better structure, but for speed mixing here or using a separate client form component
// I will keep it simple: Page is client, but I need initial data.
// Actually, better to fetch data in Server Component page.tsx and pass to Client Forms.
// I'll revert this file to be the Client Form Container, and make page.tsx Server Component.

// ... Wait, the tool is strictly overwriting. I should output the correct file content directly.
// I will create `src/components/settings/settings-forms.tsx` and then update `src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`

// Step 1: Create Forms Component
